            As stated earlier, my name is Niels Feijen. I am a Dutch 20 years old software development student at Fontys University of Applied Sciences in Eindhoven. I was born on June 7th 2002 and live in Nederwetten, Noord-Braband.

            As you can see in the picture, currently I work at Jumbo. At the bread department to be more specific. I started this job in March of 2020, before this I worked for another supermarket named Jan Linders. I worked there from September 2017 until June 2018, so not that long.
          </p>
          <p className='mt-5 3xl:mr-28'>
            Between the two jobs I have had two internships. These where done for my MBO study at Summa College. The first one lasted from August 2019 to February 2020, I held this internship at 4People in Nuenen. The second internship was from February 2021 to June 2021, and this one was held at Ninebits in Eindhoven.
          </p>

            I am also a big PSV supporter / fan, I have had a season ticket for around 9 years now and donâ€™t plan on quitting any time soon. What also is a hobby of mine is gaming, but come on did you really expect a software developer to not like gaming.
            During holidays I love going on vacation to Switzerland, me and my family have been doing this for some years now, and we still love it.
